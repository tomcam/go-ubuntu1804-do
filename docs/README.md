Installing Golang on Ubuntu 18.04.02

# TODO:
* See if 1GB was enough to compile Go etc.
* Figure out whether to go through this again w/the default ssh key, since I already had one.

## Creating the droplet

* From the green Create button, choose Droplets.
* From Ubuntu, choose 18.04.6 x64
* From Choose a plan, choose Starter, then $5/mo (or whatever)
* From Add backups, choose Yes (though not happening in this example)
* From Choose a datacenter region, choose the country closest to you.
* From Add your SSH keys, choose New SSH Key (or choose your existing one, as I did, with id_rsa.pub).
* From Finalize and create, choose 1 Droplet and consider changing the host name under Choose a hostname. I just called it dev.
* Choose Create.
* The Resources page displays
